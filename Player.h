    Each player, computer and human, will be represented by an object of class
    Player in TigerGame. This class has two public member variables: an object of
    type Hand and an integer score . Member hand is an object of class Hand because
    each player has a hand of cards. Use score to keep track of a playerâ€™s current
    score. 
    Initialize this variable to 0 using in-class initialization.
    Player has a parameterized constructor, which you will use to initialize hand .
    When called, this constructor will create an instance of Player with N cards in
    their hand. Note that this constructor is similar to the Hand constructor
